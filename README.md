This is my Journey in learning high-level programming languages

__Python__

Python is a very powerful high-level, multi-purpose programming language that is beginner friendly with easy syntax to learn

Python was created by Guiddo van Rossum while working at CWI, the National Institute of Scientific Research, as a means to provide Shell Scripting and C functionality, and was first released in 1991.

Python can be used for Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Web Development, Scripting, Automation, Mathematic Research, Data Visualization, Artificial Intelligence and many more.

Python can be used to create both Command-Line and cross-platform Graphic-User-Interface applications

Python is mainly famous amongst Hacker and Software Engineers, but can also be used by non-programmers, like Accountants or Teachers, for everyday computer use automation, due to its simple syntax

Python has lots of functionality that provides an elegant, conscise and clean way for writing code.

Python is __Awesome__ because it can do what other programming languages would need lots of lines of coding for (at least six at most), in just a few lines(at least 2 or even 1 line at most);)

__SQL__

SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system, or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system.

_SQL is the programming language used to perform CRUD operations._


SQL statements are divided into two major categories: data definition language (DDL) and data manipulation language (DML). Both of these categories contain far more statements than we can present here, and each of the statements is far more complex than we show in this introduction. If you want to master this material, we strongly recommend that you find a SQL reference for your own database software as a supplement to these pages.


__Data definition language__

DDL statements are used to build and modify the structure of your tables and other objects in the database. When you execute a DDL statement, it takes effect immediately.

__Data manipulation language__

DML statements are used to work with the data in tables. When you are connected to most multi-user databases (whether in a client program or by a connection from a Web page script), you are in effect working with a private copy of your tables that canâ€™t be seen by anyone else until you are finished (or tell the system that you are finished). You have already seen the SELECT statement; it is considered to be part of DML even though it just retreives data rather than modifying it.

__Relational Database__


A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. Relational databases are based on the relational model, an intuitive, straightforward way of representing data in tables. In a relational database, each row in the table is a record with a unique ID called the key. The columns of the table hold attributes of the data, and each record usually has a value for each attribute, making it easy to establish the relationships among data points.
