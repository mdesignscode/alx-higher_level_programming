This is my Journey in learning high-level programming languages

__Python__

Python is a very powerful high-level, multi-purpose programming language that is beginner friendly with easy syntax to learn

Python was created by Guiddo van Rossum while working at CWI, the National Institute of Scientific Research, as a means to provide Shell Scripting and C functionality, and was first released in 1991.

Python can be used for Machine Learning, Data Analysis, Web Development, Scripting, Automation, Mathematic Research, Data Visualization, Artificial Intelligence and many more.

Python can be used to create both Command-Line and cross-platform Graphic-User-Interface applications

Python is mainly famous amongst Hacker and Software Engineers, but can also be used by non-programmers, like Accountants or Teachers, for everyday computer use automation, due to its simple syntax

Python has lots of functionality that provides an elegant, conscise and clean way for writing code.

Python is __Awesome__ because it can do what other programming languages would need lots of lines of coding for (at least six at most), in just a few lines(at least 2 or even 1 line at most);)
