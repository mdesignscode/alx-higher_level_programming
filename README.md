## 📔 About Python 📔
Python is a very powerful high-level, multi-purpose programming language that is beginner friendly with easy syntax to learn

🖊 Python was created by Guiddo van Rossum while working at CWI, the National Institute of Scientific Research, as a means to provide Shell Scripting and C functionality, and was first released in 1991.

Python can be used to create both Command-Line and cross-platform Graphic-User-Interface applications

Python is mainly famous amongst Hacker and Software Engineers, but can also be used by non-programmers, like Accountants or Teachers, for everyday computer use automation, due to its simple syntax

Python has lots of functionality that provides an elegant, concise and clean way for writing code.

## ⭐️ Python is __Awesome__ because ⭐️

<i>It is designed to stress on code readability by utilizing substantial white space and simplicity as it allows programmers to write models and conceptions in less amounts of code lines compared to other languages like C++ or Java.

### Python can be used for</i>

    🤖 👨‍🎓 Machine Learning

    💹 Data Analysis

    🕸 Web Development

    🖋 Scripting

    💻 Automation

    🔍 Mathematic Research

    📊 Data Visualization

    🤖 👨‍🏭 Artificial Intelligence

<i>and many more.


In short, Python is the 🃏 jack-of-all-trades 🃏 of programming language. And mastering it can potentially allow a software developer to be an expert in all types of programing. It is fun and easy to use.</i>

## 📔 About SQL 📔

SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system, or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system.


🖊 SQL was developed by IBM researchers Raymond Boyce and Donald Chamberlin in 1972.


_SQL is the programming language used to perform CRUD operations:_
<p>📭 Create Data</p>
<p>📬 Read Data</p>
<p>📫 Update Data</p>
<p>📪 Delete Data</p>


SQL statements are divided into two major categories: data definition language (DDL) and data manipulation language (DML). Both of these categories contain far more statements than we can present here, and each of the statements is far more complex than we show in this introduction. If you want to master this material, we strongly recommend that you find a SQL reference for your own database software as a supplement to these pages.


## Data definition language

DDL statements are used to build and modify the structure of your tables and other objects in the database. When you execute a DDL statement, it takes effect immediately.

## Data manipulation language

DML statements are used to work with the data in tables. When you are connected to most multi-user databases (whether in a client program or by a connection from a Web page script), you are in effect working with a private copy of your tables that can’t be seen by anyone else until you are finished (or tell the system that you are finished). You have already seen the SELECT statement; it is considered to be part of DML even though it just retreives data rather than modifying it.

## Relational Database

A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. Relational databases are based on the relational model, an intuitive, straightforward way of representing data in tables. In a relational database, each row in the table is a record with a unique ID called the key. The columns of the table hold attributes of the data, and each record usually has a value for each attribute, making it easy to establish the relationships among data points.

## ⭐️ SQL is __Awesome__ because ⭐️
  <i> 🏗🏗🏗 It offers a high degree of data structuring; SQL is characterized by using relational database management systems, in other words, the information is contained in tables that are connected through various types of links. This enables companies to quickly extract and manipulate data and flexibly analyse it from different angles.


  🐎🐎🐎 SQL processes a large amount of data in a very short amount of time. The core operations such as deletion, insertion, and any kind of data manipulation happen at lightning speeds because of their efficiency.


  🕹 🖥 📱 💻 SQL can be used on desktop computers, gaming systems, laptops, and servers. You can even embed it within applications according to your personal needs and preferences.</i>

# JavaScript

## 📔 About JavaScript 📔

JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.

🖊 Brendan Eich created JavaScript in 1995 while working at Netscape Communications Corporation.

JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”.

The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads.
Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run.

Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the server, or actually on any device that has a special program called the JavaScript engine.

The browser has an embedded engine sometimes called a “JavaScript virtual machine”.

## ⭐️ JavaScript is __Awesome__ because ⭐️

<i>There are at least three great things about JavaScript:</i>

    💅👷 Full integration with HTML/CSS.
    🍰 Simple things are done simply.
    🕸 Supported by all major browsers and enabled by default.

<i>JavaScript is the only browser technology that combines these three things.

That’s what makes JavaScript unique. That’s why it’s the most widespread tool for creating browser interfaces.

That is not all JavaScript can do 😲
